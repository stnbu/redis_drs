"""
A Distributed Resource Scheduling system that uses Redis (and the python Redis library).

The presence of a key that contains a "resource_signature" indicates a lock. For conveniences' sake arbitrary data may
be associated with the resource_signature.

This package is heavily based upon the "redlock-py" package: https://github.com/SPSCommerce/redlock-py
